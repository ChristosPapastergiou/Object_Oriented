Programming in Object Oriented style and simulating some every day actions

How to compile and run
-------------------------------
c++  :

	compile : make run
	
	For different args just go into the make file and change it
  
java :

	compile : javac Hierarchy.java  
	run     : java Hierarchy arg1 arg2 (arg3)

The point of those projects is to make you understand how classes and methods works.
